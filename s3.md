You will need python and pip in order for this to work.
<u>**Getting your machine ready to upload:**</u> 

**Download:**

```
pip install awscli
```

Get your access keys from the system administrator for the s3 bucket. You should have two access keys, an "Access key ID" and a "Secret access key"

**Run:**

```
aws configure
```

The script will ask for a few things: 

```
AWS Access Key ID [None]: 
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 
Default region name [None]: 
Default output format [None]: 
```

Enter your two aws access keys

Press enter for the default output format  and region name (you don't need to have anything in this field)

**Run:**

`aws s3 ls ckanholding`

You should see a list of files, such as: 

```
2017-01-12 16:38:44  713031680 CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1611.iso
2017-01-12 18:35:20     104065 Linear_Bone_13.stl
2017-01-12 16:25:00         21 index.html
```

------

<u>**Uploading files**</u>

**To upload a file  or folder to the s3 bucket:**

```
aws s3 cp --recursive [folder name]  s3://ckanholding
```

```
aws s3 cp [file name]  s3://ckanholding
```
